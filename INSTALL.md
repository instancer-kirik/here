# 🏠 here - Installation Guide

**here** is a universal package manager that works when your regular package managers don't. Since it's designed to fix package management issues, it shouldn't depend on package managers to install!

## 🚀 Quick Install (Recommended)

### One-Line Installer (Linux/macOS)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://instance.select/here | bash
```

Or with wget:
```bash
wget -qO- https://instance.select/here | bash
```

This installer:
- ✅ Auto-detects your platform (Linux x86_64/ARM64, macOS Intel/Apple Silicon)
- ✅ Downloads the latest release binary
- ✅ Installs to `/usr/local/bin/here` (in your PATH)
- ✅ Verifies the installation works
- ✅ Requires no dependencies

### Custom Installation Directory
```bash
curl -fsSL https://instance.select/here | bash -s -- --dir ~/.local/bin
```
